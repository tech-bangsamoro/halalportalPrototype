## ABC Delights: A Halal Transformation Journey

*Region III Success Story - November 2025*

### The Beginning

Maria Santos never imagined her small home-based food business would become a regional sensation. Starting with just ₱50,000 capital and her grandmother's secret recipes, ABC Delights began as a weekend project in her Pampanga kitchen.

"I was making traditional Filipino desserts for family gatherings," Maria recalls. "Friends started ordering, then their friends, and suddenly I couldn't keep up with demand."

### The Halal Opportunity

In June 2025, Maria learned about the DTI's Philippine National Halal Program through the Region III focal person. Despite initial hesitation about the certification process, she decided to apply.

"I realized that Halal certification wasn't just about reaching Muslim consumers," Maria explains. "It's about maintaining the highest standards of quality, cleanliness, and ethical business practices."

### The Certification Journey

With support from the DTI-HPMO team:
- **Week 1-2**: Attended Halal awareness seminar and business assessment
- **Week 3-4**: Facility upgrade with DTI technical assistance
- **Week 5-6**: Documentation preparation and staff training
- **Week 7-8**: Successful audit and certification

The ₱68,000 subsidy covered all certification costs, making it accessible for Maria's growing business.

### The Transformation

Post-certification changes were immediate and significant:

**Business Growth:**
- Sales increased by 280% within 3 months
- Expanded from 1 to 8 full-time employees
- Opened 2 additional production facilities

**Market Expansion:**
- Now supplies to 15 supermarkets across Central Luzon
- Regular participant in Halal trade fairs
- Exports to Malaysia and Singapore

**Recognition:**
- Regional Halal Champion Awardee 2025
- Featured in national business publications
- Invited speaker at MSME forums

### Key Success Factors

1. **Quality Commitment**: "Halal certification pushed us to excellence"
2. **DTI Support**: "The program team was with us every step"
3. **Market Understanding**: "We learned to serve a diverse customer base"
4. **Continuous Innovation**: "We keep improving our products and processes"

### Advice for Aspiring Halal Entrepreneurs

Maria shares her top tips:
1. "Don't be intimidated by the certification process - DTI makes it manageable"
2. "Invest in staff training - they're your quality ambassadors"
3. "Network with other Halal-certified businesses"
4. "Think beyond local markets - Halal opens global doors"

### The Future

ABC Delights plans to:
- Launch 10 new Halal-certified products in 2026
- Establish a training center for aspiring Halal food processors
- Create 50 more jobs in the community

### Impact Numbers

- **Revenue Growth**: ₱300,000/month → ₱1,500,000/month
- **Employment Created**: 8 direct, 20 indirect jobs
- **Families Impacted**: 28 families with stable income
- **Products Certified**: 15 SKUs and growing

"The Halal certification was not just a business decision - it transformed our entire approach to food production. We're not just selling products; we're building trust and serving communities," Maria concludes.
